# AVL Tree Visualization

An AVL tree is another balanced binary search tree. Named after their inventors, Adelson-Velskii and Landis, they were the first dynamically balanced trees to be proposed. Like red-black trees, they are not perfectly balanced, but pairs of sub-trees differ in height by at most 1, maintaining an O(logn) search time. Addition and deletion operations also take O(logn) time

An AVL tree is a binary search tree which has the following properties:
              
    i) The sub-trees of every node differ in height by at most one.
    ii) Every sub-tree is an AVL tree.
    
Used C graphics library to show the functionalities of AVL tree.    

##### Following operaions are included:

      i) INSERTION()  
      ii) FIND_MINIMUM()
      iii) FIND_MAXIMUM()
      iv) SEARCH_TREE()
      v) DISPLAY_TREE()
      vi) DISPLAY_NODE()
      vii) PREORDER()
      viii) INORDER()
      ix) POSTORDER()
      x) HEIGHT()
