# N Queens Problem using Backtracking

Implemented N Queens using C graphics library and Backtracking approach. 

The program assigns the queen to each column, starting from the first row of each column and and if can't find a solution the decend
one row downwards and again checks for the safe position. In this way we only need to check only the left side of the board while placing
a queen in a particular column.

    - User Enters the Size of the board
    
    - Max size of the board can be 12x12
    
    - Program divides the screen into NxN rows and columns
    
    - Queens are showed using a dot
