# Dijkstra's Algorithm

Visualization of Shortest & 2nd shortest path in a weighted graph using Dijkstra's Algorithm

### Used the following functions:

        i) Dijkstra() -> to find the shortest path from source to all other vertices
        
        ii) Path() -> to find the path taken to go from source to destination along the shortest path
        
        iii) SSP() -> to find the second shortest path
        
        iv) draw() -> to draw the path graphically. This is invoked by path() function
        
User input the weights of the 11 edges of the one network based on that the program calculates the required path

#### Graph contains:
              
        i) Eight Vertices(8V) 
        ii) Eleven edges(11E)
