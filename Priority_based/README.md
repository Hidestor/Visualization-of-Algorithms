VISUALIZATION OF PRIORITY BASED SCHEDULING ALGORITHM 


* Priority scheduling is a non-preemptive algorithm and one of the most common scheduling algorithms in batch systems.

* Each process is assigned a priority. Process with highest priority is to be executed first and so on.

* Processes with same priority are executed on first come first served basis.

* Priority can be decided based on memory requirements, time requirements or any other resource requirement.
