# Basic Data Structure Operations Visualization
Used C graphics library and C++ object oriented cocepts.
 
 ## a) Stack: 
 In this I have implemented basic primitive operations of stack such as PUSH(), POP(), isEmpty(), isFull(), etc. 
 Along with the Stack implementation:
            
     i) Infix to Postfix Conversion
     ii) Postfix Evaluation

## b) Queue:
In this I have implemented basic primitive operations of Queue such as PUSH(), POP(), isEmpty(), isFull(), etc. 

Created a *Class queue1*

Member Methods as *add()*, *del()*, *create()* and 

Data Members as *front*, *rear*, *flag*, *max*.

## c) Linked List:
In this I have implemented basic primitive operations of Linked list such as insert_begin(), insert_end(), insert_after(), delete_after().

Created a *Class list*

Member Methods as *add(), add(int x), add(char end), del()* and 

Data Members as *struct node and size*
